# High Level Requirements

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

### At the bare minimum, this app will need to have the ability to display timers. They need to run in a "stack", that is to say, they need to run one right after the other in order. There needs to be an audible tone that signals the transition between timers. Multiple users need to be able to access this app at the same time and each be able to run it independently. 

### Users need to be able to customize the timer settings such as,

 - Length of time the timer will run
 - order in which the timers will run
 - number of timers to run

### These features should allow this product to be used for its intended purpose.

## Full - Necessary for a Functional, Shippable Product

### For the full product to be released, there are several additional features which are required.These include,

 - Ability to have User Profiles
 - Ability to save and store User timer settings
 - Ability to log in and access profile from any device

### Additional customization and a clean GUI are a must for an actual shipable product. These features include,

 - Clean and presentable GUI
 - Custom naming of the saved Timer "stacks"

## Stretch - Extra Features

### While most of the most useful features are already covered in the MVP and Full Sections, there are a few features which could be nice to have.

 - The ability to share timer "stacks" with other users. This would help with students that need to access their custom "stack" from multiple User accounts. Specifically if they don't have their own and the various teachers/therapists are the ones with accounts for this student.
 - A really cool/customizable GUI.
 - The ability to access features offline. Some schools have spotty wifi. It may be nice to access these features offline.
