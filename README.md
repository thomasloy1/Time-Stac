## Timer Application for Children Who Recieve Exceptional Children(EC) Services

### Need/Purpose

#### The purpose of this application is to assist students who are in EC with staying on task and managing their time. We have talked with several school teachers and therapists at Harnett County Schools (HCS) and they need a dedicated app to assist with keeping their students focused on the task at hand. The applications they currently use, force them to reset timers every time it goes off. This greatly reduces their ability to help the other students who do not require timers to stay on task.

### Intended Users

#### The intended users would be, at an elementary level, the teachers in the general education classrooms that have students in EC, teachers in EC Self-Contained classrooms, and the therapists that provide EC services to students. At a middle and high school level, the intended users would be the same as the elementary level but with the addition of the students who can manage operating the app.

### Features

#### This apps main feature is a series of timers that count down to zero, make a short audible tone, then proceed to the next timer in the series or "Stack". This app needs to have the ability to store multiple users and their saved preferences. In the preferences, the ability to store the timer stacks is required. The user needs the ability to store multiple stacks with the appropriate labels.

### Conclusion

#### This project will be of great use to the staff at HCS and to educators everywhere. We are excited to see the final product!
